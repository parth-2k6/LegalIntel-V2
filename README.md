## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- A Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Storage enabled.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/legalintel.git
    cd legalintel
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. This file will hold all of your secret keys.

    You will need two main credentials:
    - **Firebase Service Account Key (JSON)**: Go to your Firebase project settings -> Service accounts -> Generate new private key.
    - **Firebase Web App Config**: Go to your Firebase project settings -> General -> Your apps -> Web app -> SDK setup and configuration.
    - **Gemini API Key**: Obtain a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

    ```env
    # For Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="YOUR_CLIENT_EMAIL_FROM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FROM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT" # Make sure to handle newlines correctly

    # For Firebase Client SDK (browser-side)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_WEB_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    
    # For Genkit/Gemini
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    **Important**: When pasting the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` into the `.env` file, you may need to wrap it in quotes (`"`) and ensure the newline characters (`\n`) are correctly escaped if you copy it directly from the JSON file.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.
